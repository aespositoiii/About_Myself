# Hello, I'm Anthony Esposito.
This is where I will be sharing the projects and exercises I am using to develop my skills as a data scientist.

## Let me tell you a bit about myself.
As of January 2021 I am a Licensed Professional Engineer practicing in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
While it is difficult at times the challenges are often predictable and the steps to meet them are set in stone.
The rapidly evolving fields of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence pose an enticing set
of new problems and developing solutions that I don't want to feel left out of in the future.
